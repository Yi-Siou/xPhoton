# test region
## purpose
To check the reason why eventweight becomes weird.

Possible reason
*[x] Because YiShou updated new version error, so the error becomes very big!
- The central / up / down systematic error is not so large to impact this. The main error comes from large mcweights.
*[ ] check the reason why error is not proportional to sqrt(val). At pt/eta binning, there should have same mcweights.
- Is the difference comes from PU weight?
